\large\textit{3.5 Predicting the period of a pendulum} \hfill \textbf{53} \\

Using the dimensionless period avoids writing the factors of $2\pi$, l, and g, and it yields the simple prediction
\begin{equation}h(\theta_{0})\approx f(\theta_{0})^{{-1}/{2}}=\left( \frac{\sin\theta_{0}}{\theta_{0}} \right)^{{-1}/{2}}\end{equation}
At moderate amplitudes the approximation closely
follows the exact dimensionless period (dark curve). As a bonus, it also
predicts $h({\pi}) ={\infty}$, so it agrees with the thought experiment of releasing
the pendulum from upright (Section 3.5.3).

\textit{How much larger than the period at zero amplitude is the period at $10\circ$ amplitude?}

A 10$\circ$ amplitude is roughly 0.17 rad, a moderate angle, so the approximate
prediction for h can itself accurately be approximated using a Taylor series.
The Taylor series for $\sin\theta$ begins ${\theta}-{\theta^3/6}$, so
\begin{equation}f(\theta_{0})=\frac{\sin\theta_{0}}{\theta_{0}}\approx 1-\frac{\theta_{0}^2}{6}\end{equation}
Then $h(\theta_{0})$, which is roughly $f(\theta_{0})^{{-1}/{2}}$, becomes
\begin{equation}h\theta_{0})\approx \left(1-\frac{\theta_{0}^2}{6} \right)^{{-1}/{2}}\end{equation}
Another Taylor series yields $(1+x)^{{-1}/{2}}\approx 1 − x/2$ (for small x). Therefore,
\begin{equation}h\theta_{0})\approx 1+\frac{\theta_{0}^2}{12}\end{equation}
Restoring the dimensioned quantities gives the period itself.
\begin{equation}T\approx 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}\left(1+\frac{\theta_{0}^2}{12}\right).\end{equation}
Compared to the period at zero amplitude, a 10$\circ$ amplitude produces a
fractional increase of roughly $\theta_{0}^2/12 \approx 0.0025$ or $0.25\%$
amplitudes, the period is nearly independent of amplitude!

\large\textbf{54} \hfill \textit{3 Lumping} \\

\textit{Does our lumping approximation underestimate or overestimate the period?}

The lumping approximation simplified the pendulum differential equation
by replacing $f(\theta)$ with $f(\theta_{0})$. Equivalently, it assumed that the mass
always remained at the endpoints of the motion where $|\theta_{0}| = \theta_{0}$. Instead,
the pendulum spends much of its time at intermediate positions where
$|\theta| < \theta_{0}$ and $f(\theta) > f(\theta_{0})$. Therefore, the average f is greater than $(\theta_{0})$.
Because h is inversely related to $f (h = f^\frac{-1}{2})$, the $\colon f(\theta) \to f(\theta_{0})$ lumping
approximation overestimates h and the period.

The $\colon f(\theta) \to f(\theta_{0})$ lumping approximation, which predicts $T= 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$,
underestimates the period. Therefore, the true coefficient of the $\theta_{0}^2$
term
in the period approximation
\begin{equation}T\approx 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}\left(1+\frac{\theta_{0}^2}{12}\right)\end{equation}
lies between 0 and 1/12. A natural guess is that the coefficient lies halfway
between these extremes—namely, 1/24. However, the pendulum spends
more time toward the extremes (where $f(\theta) = f(\theta_{0})$) than it spends near
the equilibrium position (where $f(\theta)=f(\theta_{0})$). Therefore, the true coef-
ficient is probably closer to 1/12—the prediction of the $\colon f(\theta) \to f(\theta_{0})$
approximation—than it is to 0. An improved guess might be two-thirds
of the way from 0 to 1/12, namely 1/18.

In comparison, a full successive-approximation solution of the pendulum
differential equation gives the following period [13, 33]:
\begin{equation}T\approx 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}\left(1+\frac{\theta_{0}^2}{16}+\frac{11}{3072}\theta_{0}^4+...\right).\end{equation}
Our educated guess of 1/18 is very close to the true coefficient of 1/16!

\large\textbf{3.6 Summary and further problems}

Lumping turns calculus on its head. Whereas calculus analyzes a changing
process by dividing it into ever finer intervals, lumping simplifies a
changing process by combining it into one unchanging process. It turns
curves into straight lines, difficult integrals into multiplication, and mildly
nonlinear differential equations into linear differential equations.

\large\textbf{Problem 3.36 FWHM for another decaying function} 

Use the FWHM heuristic to estimate
\begin{equation}\int_{-\infty}^\infty\ \frac{dx}{1+x^4}\end{equation}
Then compare the estimate with the exact value of $\pi/\sqrt{2}$. For an enjoyable
additional problem, derive the exact value.

\large\textbf{Problem 3.37 Hypothetical pendulum equation} 

Suppose the pendulum equation had been
\begin{equation}\frac{d^2\theta}{d\theta^2} + \frac{l}{g}\tan \theta=0\end{equation}
How would the period T depend on amplitude $\theta_{0}$? In particular, as $\theta_{0}$ increases,
would T decrease, remain constant, or increase? What is the slope $dT/d\theta_{0}$ at
zero amplitude? Compare your results with the results of Problem 3.33.

For small but nonzero $\theta_{0}$, find an approximate expression for the dimensionless
period $h(\theta_{0})$ and use it to check your previous conclusions.
\large\textbf{Problem 3.38 Gaussian 1-sigma tail} 
The Gaussian probability density function with zero mean and unit variance is
\begin{equation}p(x)=\frac{e^{-x^2/2}}{\sqrt{2\pi}}.\end{equation}
The area of its tail is an important quantity in statistics, but it has no closed form.
In this problem you estimate the area of the 1-sigma tail
\begin{equation}\int_{1}^\infty\ \frac{e^{-x^2/2}}{\sqrt{2\pi}}dx=\frac{1-erf(1/\sqrt{2})}{2}\approx 1.59,\end{equation}
where erf(z) is the error function.

\large\textbf{Problem 3.37 Hypothetical pendulum equation} 
For the canonical probability Gaussian, estimate the area of its n-sigma tail (for
large n). In other words, estimate
\begin{equation}\int_{n}^\infty\ \frac{e^{-x^2/2}}{\sqrt{2\pi}} dx\end{equation}
